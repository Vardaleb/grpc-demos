This example implements a client, that observes events generated by a gRPC server. 
* The server is implemented in `dart`
* The client is a `flutter` application

The structure of this directory is as follows:
```bash
.
├── client
├── events
├── proto
└── server
```
# proto
The protobuf messages and services are defined in this directory. 
The code can be created with the shell script [`generate-proto.sh`](https://github.com/Vardaleb/grpc-demos/blob/main/event-observer/generate-proto.sh), which puts the genereated files in the library project `events`
This way, we do not have to duplicate the `dart` classes for the server and the client. There is only one service defined in the file [`event.proto`](https://github.com/Vardaleb/grpc-demos/blob/main/event-observer/proto/event.proto):
```proto
service EventService {
  rpc Observe(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (stream Event);
}
```
# events
# server
# client
